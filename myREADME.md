My thought process approaching this challenge:

Routes:

1. HomePage (allows for inserting names)
2. Challenge Page (allows for the player to choose an option of rock, paper or scissors)
3. Different Pages for each choice (computer choice is randomly generated)
4. End Page (to show the scores of the two players. When the roles switch player 1 again chooses an option, and the computer choice is randomly generated)

Views:

1. HomePage
2. Challenge Page
3. Different Page for each choice (Rock, Paper & Scissors)
4. Results Page

\*\*\* Edit: For each of the choices, the results can also be presented on this page to reduce the number of views and router pages
